Finally after a long time of hard work, tears, and tears, my project is finally at production. All that is left is to set up docker for mobility and, if i was to, it would be ready to slap onto a server and run. It is not the prettiest website, but that is why I am a developer and not a designer. The production version, included unpacked javascript source files is publicly listed on my github. (the server is currently tuned for serving packed files so do not expect changes to the src folder to affect what you see). I used most of the MERN stack except mongo since the website has no real need for a database and the /contactus form is a dead end since I was not sure what i wanted to do with the data wether to log it to console or to try setting up mongoDB to store the data (for proving ability to use it and completely using the MERN stack only, not really a good way to handle actual messages since it would be hard for anyone to keep up with them), or even routing the messages to the "company" email. I used webpack to package the files, unfortunately.
